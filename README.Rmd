=============

Poster presenting the [taxize](https://github.com/ropensci/taxize) package at
[International Statistical Ecology Conference 2014](http://isec2014.sciencesconf.org/) in  Montpellier (1-4 July 2014).

This poster is in the spirit of ROpenSci completly reproducible ;)

It is written in LaTeX using the beamerposter package.
The used theme is a modification of [Rob Hyndmans theme](http://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/beamer-poster/).
Integration of R is done via [knitr](https://github.com/yihui/knitr).

To reproduce the poster compile `poster.Rnw`:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
require(knitr)
knit('poster.Rnw', output = 'repro.tex')
texi2pdf('repro.tex')
```
